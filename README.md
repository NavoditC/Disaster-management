# Disaster-management
Predictions can be made using machine learning to become alert about upcoming calamities.It can also assist rescue teams by providing information about damage levels.
​
Predictions:
->Images from satellites can be used to predict landslides and floods.
->Possibility of floods can be predicted by examining the water table and people can be made aware in advance.
->Data and statistical parameters of earthquake prone areas can be analysed to make predictions.
->Predictive analysis can be made by tracking patterns to become aware of calamities in advance.
​
Management:
->By the press of a button an alert will be sent to the nearest rescue team(Alertness level will be judged by images from satellites,photos from users,and number of help requests received).
->A victim will be helped to find nearest evacuation center(and this data can be saved for offline use also).
->Information can be given to authorities regarding which places are most affected and at which instantaneous help is required.
->Requests can be made in case of calamities to seek manpower and monetary help.

​
Techiques to be used:
->Image mapping
->Computer vision
->Location service
->Earthquake forecasting
